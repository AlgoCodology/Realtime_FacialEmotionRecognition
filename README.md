# Realtime_FacialEmotionRecognition - Including Trained Models and Running instructions.
This project showcases application of Convolutional neural network based models for realtime facial emotion recognition. The video feed is taken from a native video capture device such as the webcam. The model runs in an online manner to display realtime prediction of emotions basis the Human face detected in the webcam feed using haar cascade xml files for a human face.

For detailed file by file walkthrough and information of how to execute, please refer the "readme_FacialEmotionRecognition.py.txt" and "readme_VideoCaptureOpenCV.py.txt" files.

The FER 2013 (facial emotion recognition) dataset that is also included with this repository is taken from and available at:
